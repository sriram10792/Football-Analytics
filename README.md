EPL soccer match prediction and Player analytics


1) To predict the winner in a EPL match based on several parameters such as Form, Goals scored, Goals conceded, Home/Away etc

2) Implement a player analytics, focused on Cristiano Ronaldo. The objective is to implement a model without using the straight forward packages from sklearn. Cristiano Ronaldo is analysed based on a data and the number of goals he will score in the next season is predicted. Though the model is simple, the idea is to implement the machine learning concepts such as cost function, OLS, gradient descent using matrices and algebra.
